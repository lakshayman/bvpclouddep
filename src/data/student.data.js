In modern times cloud servers are the requirements for every industry, so it is a must know technology for everyone. My first project on cloud was a static website that I have created using Amazon Lightsail. It was a great experience creating a website using cloud as it provided me every functionality at ease.",

I was very curious about different fields at the time, and Cloud Computing picked my interest greatly. After learning the fundamentals of Cloud Computing, I was given an opportunity to sit for Microsoft's AZ-900 Exam and I passed it with an amazing score. Now, in my third year, I am also exploring the field of DevOps and contributing to Open-Source. I didn't want to settle down with just Azure, so I started learning AWS too.",

Both secretly made lives beautiful for sure! after joining my  engineering college, I finally got enlightened about the fact that this word ‘cloud’ had a lot more it. I heard these words “Cloud” and “Cloud computing” excessively being thrown in almost all the seminars, guest lectures, etc. So I finally decided to research on this topic. I got the opportunity to explore the field of cloud computing through in-house training program of our college with the organisation Text Explica under the mentorship of Mr. Varun Jha and Mrs.Alka Leekha.Throughout the training course we learned about various cloud service providers like AWS(Amazon Web Services), Microsoft Azure and also did a project on AWS.The main objective of the project was to explore and learn about various services offered by AWS and host a dynamic website on the cloud. All in all it was a great experience and there was alot to take away from the training.With the enormous benifits of cloud computing and its bright future scope I wish to develop more industry level projects in cloud and also persue a career in it.",

Cloud services provide excellent infrastructure, resources and allows user to avail an extensive network of global web servers. Over the course of my training, I learnt, that many time consuming processes can be done efficiently, services provide better security and are highly cost effective. We were trained by Tech Explica. Our mentor, Mr Varun Jha, was extremely knowledgeable and trained us with the focus on how cloud services are used in industries all around the globe. I worked on Website Development using Elastic Beanstalk, where our team used AWS resources like Elastic Beanstalk, DynamoDB, Lifecycle Manager and AWS EC2 instances to deploy a dynamic website. The training process was an incredible learning experience.",

It has grown rapidly since its inception and experts predict that it will continue to do so for many years to come. With no knowledge of cloud computing to having hands-on experience with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, it has been an amazing journey with Tech Explica. Mentors hand-hold you throughout your training to ensure a smooth learning experience. I have built a CDN under my mentor’s guidance for an EC2 deployed Wordpress website that ensures scalability, security and fault tolerance of the system. Through the cloud training, I was able to identify clear, actionable steps towards achieving my goals.",
